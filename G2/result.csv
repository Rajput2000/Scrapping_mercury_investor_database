Hosting multiple appliaction in a single server with good efficiency can reduce costs for hosting multiple applications.
Deploying servers looks like the work of IT professioanls but it was easy for even a non IT person to use Cloudways.
The support is available 24/7 and the best part is that SSL certificate is aviaable for all applications you deploy,What do you dislike about Cloudways?If you like to deploy a single appliaction with low-mid level traffic, then cloudways is not a good option because it will be expensive.What problems is Cloudways solving and how is that benefiting you?Cloudways has been very benefitial for managing wordpress hosting for multiple websites.

It also provided free SSL certificates.
Highly recommended.What do you dislike about Cloudways?Cloudways may become expensive if you want to host less applications with low traffic, it will be costlier, the same application can be deployed on cheaper platforms, so if you want to host a simple application, with simple bandwith and ram, cloudways is not an ideal choice.

I wish the Cloudflare statistics could look back further than 72 hours. Also, some of the add-ons are priced per month, so if you start at the end of a billing cycle you will be charged for the entire month still.

The hosting's performance is also impressive, especially if you're running a WordPress site, thanks to the built-in Breeze cache that keeps things speedy. Another great feature is the variety of add-ons available; you can easily connect to popular services like Rackspace for email and Cloudflare for CDN, which adds a lot of flexibility to your setup.What do you dislike about Cloudways?One downside to Cloudways is that if you're planning to build a more advanced website with custom pipelines and extensive server configurations, you might find it a bit limiting. It doesn’t offer as much flexibility for those who need to dive deep into server customization, which could be a drawback if your project requires more complex setups.What problems is Cloudways solving and how is that benefiting you?I decided to go with Cloudways for hosting because they offer a complete package that fits all my website's needs.

We needed to upgrade from a VPS environment for our Wordpress site to a faster environment. We were looking into a dedicated server environment when we came across WP Engine. It could be faster, if we knew how to manage and optimize a dedicated server for our Wordpress site, but we don't have the technical know-how to make that happen. WP Engine fits our current needs better. When the current setup becomes insufficient because our web traffic increases we will have to re-evaluate.

The staging environment

Being able to make a copy of our site on the fly and test our updates on a staging environment is what everyone who is serious about their site should have. When the updates are tested and approved by the executive team, then at a click of a button, the staging version of the site replaces the old version.

The tech support team is very knowledgeable.

They are also very willing to do some of the ""repairs"" and maintenance work themselves to make sure it is done well.

Automated Backups

Everyone says they do automated backups, but WP Engine's solution is very easy to use. They give you access to several weeks worth of daily backups that you can revert to at any time. Creating a backup before making an update is easy to do and therefore it is actually done.
What do you dislike about WP Engine?Wait times on Live chat is usually around (15-20) minutes. It has been over 30 minutes a handful of times.
Also their service has experience intermittent issues, especially in December 2015 with a couple of bad weeks. Downtime added up to 5 hours over the course of that month. It turned out that they had been victim to a DDoS attack and had been fighting to move their clients around to maintain service. All things considered, it was handled pretty well.Recommendations to others considering WP Engine:Look into hosting your site on a dedicated server before making the switch. If your tech team can manage it, it could be a better fit for you than WP Engine's shared hosting environment.What problems is WP Engine solving and how is that benefiting you?We had been hosting our site on a Virtual Private Server before and were looking to upgrade to a dedicated server. WP Engine offered a solution at a similar price point. While their solution means that our site is still hosted in a shared environment, the idea that if anything goes wrong, there is a strong team that can help is a big deal."

However, over time after multiple site outages that were for nonsense reasons, my initial happiness with their service disapated. Excuses, misinformation, and lies from management take their toll.What do you dislike about SiteGround?I've been with SiteGround for four years, and I can't express enough how disappointed I am with their service. Here are the main issues I've encountered:

Unjustified Traffic Blocks: SiteGround blocks legitimate traffic at the slightest temporary increase, claiming a suspected attack. They don't verify if the site is under attack; they just block it by default. For example, when we announced webinars and had a modest increase in traffic (around 300 people signing up), they decided we were under attack, and we lost the ability for people to register. Despite their SLAs, I was never offered appropriate compensation.

Cryptic Messaging: Their messages are cryptic and often induce panic. They regularly send alerts that you're over the limit on something, listing a domain with little to no traffic. They arbitrarily pick one of your domains to raise an alert on, wasting time as you try to figure out what's happening.

Dismissive Management: When issues are escalated, their management team is dismissive, using phrases like ""we will review"", ""we will try to improve"", and ""we will analyze,"" but they never commit to taking action. Even when pressed, the best commitment you get is vague promises about the ""possibility of a change.""

Dishonesty: I've caught their management outright lying in their replies. They provide BS excuses for blocking legitimate traffic, and when the actual traffic is analyzed, they fabricate reasons to justify their actions.

After enduring these issues for four years, I've finally had enough and moved my sites to another provider. I cannot stress enough how much SiteGround should be avoided.What problems is SiteGround solving and how is that benefiting you?After four years with SiteGround, I've had enough of their appalling service and dismissive management. They block legitimate traffic at the slightest increase, claiming suspected attacks without verification. For instance, our site was blocked during a webinar sign-up surge, causing us to lose registrations. Despite their SLAs, no compensation was offered.

Their management is equally disappointing. They send cryptic, panic-inducing messages about exceeding limits on low-traffic domains and, when issues are escalated, they provide non-committal responses like ""we will review"" without any real action. Worse yet, I've caught them making up outright lies to explain away their terrible service. SiteGround's unreliable service and dishonest management make them a provider to avoid."

We are able to push updates without having to worry abour servers and technical issues.What do you dislike about Pantheon?The billing experience is now a nightmare. For the last 2 years we have had to endure a lot of pain with the billing process and lately it has taken a turn south. Our Indian credit card does not work on their site. Becaue of this, we need to reach out to support to have them send us a special link that will allow us to make a payment. A mistake due to lack of adequate labelling in a warning message, a site was downgraded. This lead to downtime. The fix is a quick CC payment. But because pantheon does not accept Indian credit cards, and being in a different timezone, we have been told that a fix will take 7-8 hours at the least. The support agents are not equipped and empowered to send us a special link to make a payment and we have to wait for the billing agents to wake up to help us. Hours lost in downtime.What problems is Pantheon solving and how is that benefiting you?The hosting is completely managed. Technically on the hosting side, we have not needed to worry about our sites."
